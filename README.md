# Sample-Superstore-Data-Analysis
Exploratory data analysis of Kaggle's Sample Superstore dataset using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn.
This is my first solo data analysis project , and I'm learning along the way! I used Python to clean, explore, and visualize the data from the Superstore dataset.

# Why I Did This
I wanted to practice working with a real dataset from start to finish.  
This project helped me learn how to:
- Load and clean messy data,
- Explore trends and patterns,
- Turn business questions into analysis.

# What I Did :
- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Cleaned the data (checked for missing values, renamed columns, converted date columns)
- Analyzed sales and profit by category and sub-category
- Visualized data with bar charts and a correlation heatmap
- Removed outliers using the IQR method

# What I Found
- Technology has the highest sales and profit.
- Furniture has the lowest profit and can even result in losses.
- Phones and Chairs are the top-selling sub-categories.
- Sales and profit are positively correlated.
- Discounts don't seem to strongly increase sales.

# Visualization
- Sales by Category
- Profit by Category
- Sales by Sub-Category
- Correlation Heatmap
